# stardew-valley-mod-hardwood-at-carpenter

a simple Stardew Valley mod that adds hardwood to the carpenters shop inventory at a reasonable price of 450 gold

based on:
https://github.com/IrregularPorygon/SMAPIGenericShopMod/tree/master/GenericShopExtender

which is a lot more configureable, but i only needed hardwood and i wanted it to be in the list right after regular wood! :P
